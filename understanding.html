	<h1>Understanding in Bloom's Taxonomy</h1>
	<p>Understanding is the second level of Bloom's Taxonomy, which involves making sense of or explaining information that has been learned.</p>
	<p>Examples of understanding include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Explaining a concept in your own words</li>
		<li>Summarizing a reading passage</li>
		<li>Interpreting a chart or graph</li>
		<li>Translating information from one form to another</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Understanding is important because it helps learners to make connections between different pieces of information and apply their knowledge in new contexts.</p>
	<p>Some strategies for promoting understanding include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Asking questions to clarify and deepen understanding</li>
		<li>Using analogies or real-life examples to make abstract concepts more concrete</li>
		<li>Encouraging learners to identify patterns and relationships between different pieces of information</li>
		<li>Providing opportunities for learners to apply their understanding in new situations</li>
	</ul>
